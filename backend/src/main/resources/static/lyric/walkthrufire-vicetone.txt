Talk to me
Spill the secrets you've been keeping
Life cuts deep
Let me help pick up the pieces
You're not alone, I'm by your side
Don't you know, don't you know
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
No matter what, I'll make it right
Don't you know, don't you know
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
I'm not an angel, I'm not a saint
I've been a closed book full of mistakes
But when you're broken, when you're in pain
Ooh, ooh
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
You know I
Don't pretend to be a savior
But let me in, yeah
I promise that nobody can break us
You're not alone, I'm by your side
Don't you know, don't you know
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
No matter what, I'll make it right
Don't you know, don't you know
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
I'm not an angel, I'm not a saint
I've been a closed book full of mistakes
But when you're broken, when you're in pain
Ooh, ooh
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire with you
You're not alone, I'm by your side
Don't you know, don't you know
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
I'm not an angel, I'm not a saint
I've been a closed book full of mistakes
But when you're broken, when you're in pain
Ooh, ooh
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire
I'll walk through fire with you
I'll walk through fire with you
